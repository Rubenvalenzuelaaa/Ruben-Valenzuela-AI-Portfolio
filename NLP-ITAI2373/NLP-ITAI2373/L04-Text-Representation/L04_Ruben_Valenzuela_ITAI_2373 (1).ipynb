        "\n",
        "**Question 1:** Based on your classification results, which text representation method performed best? Why do you think this is the case?\n",
        "\n",
        "The word embeddings method performed the best in my classification task. I believe this is because embeddings capture the semantic meaning and contextual relationships between words, unlike Bag of Words or TF-IDF, which only rely on word frequency. Embeddings provide dense vectors that help machine learning models better understand the nuances of language.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "---\n",
        "\n",
        "**Question 2:** Describe a real-world application where you would use each of the following:\n",
        "BOW representation: For spam email detection where simple word frequency patterns are sufficient.\n",
        "\n",
        "TF-IDF representation: For document search engines like legal or academic databases, where term importance across documents matters.\n",
        "\n",
        "Word embeddings: For chatbot development or sentiment analysis where understanding context and meaning is crucial.\n",
        "---\n",
        "\n",
        "**Question 3:** What ethical considerations should be taken into account when deploying a text classification system in a real-world application (e.g., resume screening, content moderation)?\n",
        "\n",
        "Ethical concerns include bias in training data, potential discrimination, lack of transparency, and accountability. For example, in resume screening, biased training data could lead to unfair rejections based on gender, ethnicity, or education background. It's crucial to audit models regularly, ensure diverse data sources, and maintain human oversight in high-stakes applications.\n",
        "\n",
        "---\n",
        "\n",
        "**Question 4:** How has your understanding of text representation evolved over these 5 parts? What was the most surprising thing you learned?\n",
        "\n",
        "My understanding has grown from basic frequency-based techniques to more advanced semantic-aware methods. At first, I thought counting words was enough, but I was surprised by how powerful word embeddings are in preserving meaning and context. The fact that you can perform analogies with word vectors (like \"king\" - \"man\" + \"woman\" ≈ \"queen\") really impressed me.\n",
        "---\n",
        "\n",
        "**Question 5:** If you were to continue learning about text representation, what topics would you want to explore next?\n",
        "\n",
        "I would like to explore contextual embeddings like BERT or GPT models, which consider the entire sentence structure rather than treating words independently. I’m also curious about fine-tuning pre-trained models for specific NLP tasks and understanding how transformers revolutionized text processing."
