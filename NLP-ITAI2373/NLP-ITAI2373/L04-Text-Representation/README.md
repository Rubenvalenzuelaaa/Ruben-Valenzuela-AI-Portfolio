# L04 – Text Representation

This lab explores core techniques for representing text data in Natural Language Processing (NLP), including:

- Bag of Words (BoW)
- TF-IDF
- N-grams
- Word Embeddings

The objective is to implement and compare these representations to understand their effectiveness in downstream NLP tasks.
