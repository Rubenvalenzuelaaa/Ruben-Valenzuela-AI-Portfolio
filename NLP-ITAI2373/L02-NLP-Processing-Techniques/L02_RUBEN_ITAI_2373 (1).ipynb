This helps match many variations of a term, which is useful when retrieving relevant results quickly.\n",

        "2. **Which text type was least affected?** What does this tell you about the nature of that text?\n",

        "\n",
        "4. **What are the main trade-offs you need to consider when choosing preprocessing techniques for any NLP project?**\n",
        "\n",
        "1. Most affected text type:\n",
        "Product Review (61.7% reduction).\n",
        "This happened because product reviews tend to include many adjectives, personal expressions, and informal language. These elements are often removed during preprocessing since they may be considered stop words or redundant, even though they carry emotional weight that‚Äôs crucial for tasks like sentiment analysis.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. Least affected text type:\n",
        "Simple Text (50.0% reduction).\n",
        "This suggests the text was already clear, concise, and contained minimal noise. It used straightforward language and fewer irrelevant words, so preprocessing didn‚Äôt need to remove much.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. For customer review analysis:\n",
        "The best choice would be a standard preprocessing approach. It strikes a balance by cleaning unnecessary noise while preserving emotionally charged or opinionated words like ‚Äúfantastic,‚Äù ‚Äúabsolutely,‚Äù or ‚Äúlove.‚Äù These words are essential for understanding customer sentiment. An aggressive approach might delete too many of these key indicators.\n",
        "\n",
        "4. Main trade-offs to consider:\n",
        "Noise reduction vs. context loss: Cleaning up text helps models process it efficiently, but too much cleaning can remove subtle but important information like emotion, sarcasm, or negation.\n",
        "\n",
        "Speed vs. accuracy: Aggressive preprocessing is faster and better for real-time applications, but it can reduce output quality in tasks like sentiment analysis or summarization.\n",
        "\n",
        "Generalization vs. expressiveness: Simpler text helps general NLP models perform better, but retaining rich language is important for tasks that require nuance and deeper understanding."
